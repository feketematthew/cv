    <h3>My drinking experiences so far</h3>
    <hr size="2">
    <p>So on this page I'm going to talk about the drinks I've come across my life,<br>
      and also my opinion about each one of them.</p>

        <td>Beer</td>
        <td>The best overall experience so far.<br> I couldn't precisely say why,<br> but I can tell you that:<br>
          <strong>Beer has it all.</strong><br></td>
<td>
          <ul>
            <li>Not the highest alcohol concentration of course, so it makes a perfect daily driver,<br>
              moreover a perfect substitution for like every other bevarage.</li>
            <li>It doesn't taste like an alcoholic drink at all. It's a rather likeable taste compared to other alcoholic drinks.</li>
            <li>Since it has the lowest alcohol concentration, you can drink it <strong>all day</strong> and still feel fine in the evening.</li>
            <li>Price of couse, regarding the amount you need to feel <strong>good</strong>, it is by far the cheapest of any drinks.</li>

        <td>Wine</td>
        <td>Wine is actually a strange drink nowadays.<br>
        You can get a high priced one <br>
        and really feel like an aristocrat <br>
        or <br>
        you can just go with the cheapest one <br>
        and get drunk easily. <br>
      </td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>For me personally the cheaper wines are only drinkable with coke.<br>
          -->you have to buy coke as well.</li>
          <li>The price: (for me) it increases because not only do I have to buy a wine, but also coke.<br>
          (without the coke it would still be more expensive than the beer)</li>
          <li>Girls love it.</li>
          <li>If you ever visit Hungary, try <strong>La Fiesta</strong></li>
